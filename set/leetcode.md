Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
==============================

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Largest Rectangle in Historgram
===============================

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height
where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in
the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

For example, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3], return 10.
